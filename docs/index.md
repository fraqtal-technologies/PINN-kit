# PINN-kit

A comprehensive toolkit for **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** that empowers researchers and engineers to solve complex differential equations using deep learning.

!!! abstract "What is PINN-kit?"
    PINN-kit provides an intuitive interface for implementing and training physics-informed neural networks, 
    combining the power of deep learning with the rigor of physics-based modeling.

## Key Features

- **Easy-to-use interface** for defining physics-informed neural networks
- **Flexible domain handling** utilities for arbitrary input variables  
- **High-performance training** with PyTorch backend
- **Built-in visualization** tools for results analysis
- **Support for various** differential equation types
- **Clean, modular design** for easy customization

## Quick Start

### Installation

PINN-kit supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pinn-kit
```

!!! tip "Virtual Environment"
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment with Python 3.12+ to avoid dependency conflicts:
    
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install pinn-kit
    ```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pinn_kit import PINN, Domain

# Create a domain with flexible variable definition
domain = Domain([
    ('x', -1, 1),  # x-coordinate bounds
    ('y', -1, 1),  # y-coordinate bounds  
    ('t', 0, 1)    # time bounds
])

# Initialize a PINN with 3 inputs, 2 hidden layers, 1 output
pinn = PINN([3, 20, 20, 1])

# Define your physics-informed loss function
def physics_loss():
    # Your physics constraints here
    return loss_value

# Train the network
pinn.train_model(domain, physics_loss, epochs=1000)
```

!!! success "That's it!"
    PINN-kit handles all the complexity behind the scenes, letting you focus on your physics problem.
